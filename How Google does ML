* Created over 4000 Tensorflow ML models
* Infrastructure for ML - How do you process batch data and stream data the same way? - On GCP, the key services are all serverless and they're all managed infrastructure.
* Data is key to any ML model. Invest in getting more data
* A ML model is a mathematical function. Models generalize from the examples provided to it
* The key to making a machine learning model generalized is data, and lots and lots of it. Having labeled the data is a precondition for successful machine learning.
