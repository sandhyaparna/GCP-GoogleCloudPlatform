Activate datalab
* In Google cloud platform, open cloud shell - datalab create vminstancename --zone us-central1-a
* To open instance that has already been created - datalab connect vminstancename

In the datalab clone a github repository: <br/>
%bash <br/>
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst <br/>
rm -rf training-data-analyst/.git <br/>



Using Cloud DataPrep - join data, create new features; save data to BigQuery-Perform Aggregation; Use DataLab to visualize data
