Estimator API
Quick model - Many standard pre-made estimator models
Checkpoints to pause and resume your training
Out-of-memory datasets - Estimators are designed with a data set API that handles out of memory data sets.
Train/eval/monitor - You can not train a large network without seeing how its doing. Estimators automatically surface key metrics during training that you can visualize in Tensor board.
Distributed Training - Estimators come with the necessary cluster execution code already built in.
Hyper-parameter tuning of ML-engine
Production:serving predictions from a trained model

#### Checkpoints
Allows you to continue training, resume on failure, and predict from a train model <br/>
Specify a folder directory <br/>
Please be aware that restarting from the latest checkpoint, is the default behavior of estimators. If you want to restart from scratch, delete this folder. <br/>
model = tf.estimator.LinearRegressor(featcols,'./model_trained') <br/>
model.train(train_input_fun, steps=100) <br/>
