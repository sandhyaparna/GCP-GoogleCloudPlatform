Estimator API
Quick model - Many standard pre-made estimator models
Checkpoints to pause and resume your training
Out-of-memory datasets - Estimators are designed with a data set API that handles out of memory data sets.
Train/eval/monitor - You can not train a large network without seeing how its doing. Estimators automatically surface key metrics during training that you can visualize in Tensor board.
Distributed Training - Estimators come with the necessary cluster execution code already built in.

Production:serving predictions from a trained model

#### Checkpoints
Allows you to continue training, resume on failure, and predict from a train model <br/>
Specify a folder directory <br/>
Please be aware that restarting from the latest checkpoint, is the default behavior of estimators. If you want to restart from scratch, delete this folder. <br/>
* By default, training will run until your training data is exhausted or exhausted n times if you specifies you want n epochs in your input function. 
* You can also override this with an explicit number of steps when calling the train function. 
* There are two variants for the step setting. 
  * Steps equals 1,000 will run 1,000 additional training steps starting from the last checkpoint. One step here corresponds to one batch of input data. 
  * Max steps equals 1,000 on the other hand restarts from the latest check points reads the step count reached in the previous run and continues until the step count reaches max steps. This can potentially do nothing if the checkpoint was already there.
